Circuitscape for Processing
---------------------------
Circuitscape is a free software package that borrows algorithms from electronic
circuit theory to predict connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes. Its most
common applications include modeling movement and gene flow of plants and
animals, as well as identifying areas important for connectivity conservation.
Circuit theory complements commonly-used connectivity models because of its
connections to random walk theory and its ability to simultaneously evaluate
contributions of multiple dispersal pathways.

Processing (former SEXTANTE) is a geoprocessing environment that can be used to
call native and third party algorithms from QGIS, making your spatial analysis
tasks more productive and easy to accomplish.

This plugin implements Circuitscape provider for QGIS Processing framework.
